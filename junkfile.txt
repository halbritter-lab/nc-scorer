# NC-Scorer

## Overview

NCScorer is a tool developed to standardize and automate the assessment of candidate variants in Exome Sequencing (ES) for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). The tool leverages a scoring system called the Nephro Candidate Score (NCS) to prioritize candidate variants for further investigation, accelerating the discovery of new genetic associations in CKD.
