Each key score is displayed with a subtle background color and left border in the primary theme color\n2. Score chips have a slight elevation effect for a 3D appearance\n3. Higher scores are generally displayed in colors ranging from yellow (low) to green (high)\n4. Critical scores below certain thresholds may be highlighted in orange or red\n5. The most important scores (Nephro Candidate Gene Score, Nephro Variant Score, and Inheritance Score) are displayed with bold text and special visual treatment\n\nThis visual hierarchy helps you quickly identify the important values that contribute to the final assessment."
