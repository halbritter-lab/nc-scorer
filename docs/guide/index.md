# Getting Started

NC-Scorer is a tool developed to standardize and automate the assessment of candidate variants in Exome Sequencing (ES) for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu).

## Overview

The tool leverages a scoring system called the Nephro Candidate Score (NCS) to prioritize candidate variants for further investigation, accelerating the discovery of new genetic associations in CKD.

## Key Features

- **Automated Scoring**: Uses the NCS algorithm to assess genetic variants
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple variants simultaneously
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with Vue 3, Vuetify 3, and Vite
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from Ensembl and other genomic databases
- **Export Options**: Multiple formats including CSV, TSV, JSON, and VCF

## Quick Start

1. Visit the [NC-Scorer application](https://nc-scorer.kidney-genetics.org/)
2. Search for a gene or variant using the search interface
3. Review the calculated scores and annotations
4. Export results for further analysis
