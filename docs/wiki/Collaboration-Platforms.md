# Researcher Collaboration Platforms

This guide provides information about platforms designed to help researchers connect with others studying the same genes and variants. These platforms can be valuable for sharing data, validating findings, and forming collaborations to accelerate discoveries in rare disease research.

## Primary Platforms

### GeneMatcher
**Website**: [https://genematcher.org/](https://genematcher.org/)

GeneMatcher is a free service designed to connect clinicians and researchers studying the same gene. 

**Key features**:
- Submit a gene of interest and be notified of matches
- Connect with other researchers through secure messaging
- Developed at the Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics
- Part of the Matchmaker Exchange federated platform

### Matchmaker Exchange
**Website**: [https://www.matchmakerexchange.org/](https://www.matchmakerexchange.org/)

Matchmaker Exchange is a federated network connecting databases of genotypes and rare phenotypes using a common API.

**Key features**:
- Connect multiple matching services through a single interface
- Search across multiple international databases
- Supports both phenotype and genotype matching
- Includes GeneMatcher, DECIPHER, MyGene2, and other platforms

## Additional Resources

### DECIPHER
**Website**: [https://www.deciphergenomics.org/](https://www.deciphergenomics.org/)

DECIPHER (DatabasE of genomiC varIation and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources) is a database and platform for sharing and interpreting genomic variants.

**Key features**:
- Share anonymized phenotypic and genotypic data
- Identify similar cases worldwide
- Visualize genomic data for better interpretation
- Supports both research and clinical diagnosis

### VarSome Connect
**Website**: [https://varsome.com/](https://varsome.com/)

VarSome is a platform that aggregates information about human genomic variants and offers a social connecting feature.

**Key features**:
- VarSome Connect allows users to see if others have queried the same variant
- Facilitates direct connections between researchers
- Integrated with comprehensive variant annotation tools
- Community-based variant classification

## Best Practices for Research Collaboration

1. **Data Sharing**: Share as much non-identifiable information as possible to facilitate meaningful connections
2. **Patient Consent**: Ensure you have appropriate consent for sharing genetic and phenotypic information
3. **Follow-up**: Maintain communication with potential collaborators
4. **Citation**: Acknowledge the platform used to establish the collaboration in any resulting publications
5. **Contribute**: Consider contributing your findings back to the community

## How to Use the Collaboration Links in NC-Scorer

1. After analyzing a variant in NC-Scorer, click the "Find Collaborators" button next to the download option
2. Select a platform from the dropdown menu
3. For GeneMatcher, the gene symbol will be automatically included in the link
4. Register on the selected platform if you haven't already
5. Submit your variant/gene information according to the platform's guidelines
